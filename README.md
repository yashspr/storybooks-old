# StoryBooks

StoryBooks is essentially a blogging platform where users can login using their Google account and post stories (posts) about anything they wish to. The posts can be set to Public or Private (not visible to other users/visitors of the website). The web application uses the Google API to fetch details about the user once the user authenticates.

The application uses MongoDB as the database and it is hosted on Heroku for you to try it. Check it out [here](https://pacific-woodland-41688.herokuapp.com/)
